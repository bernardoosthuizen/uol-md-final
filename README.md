## Viewing the app
### Expo Go
Alternatively, the app can also be viewed via [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go). 
1. Download Expo Go on your mobile device from the App Store [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/expo-go/id982107779) or Google Play Store [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent&hl=en&pli=1). Just so you know, you do NOT need to create an Expo account.
2. Scan the QR code below with the device's camera if you're using iOS or open Expo Go on Android and scan it from within the app. Or use [this link](https://expo.dev/preview/update?message=sign%20up%20flow%20fixed&updateRuntimeVersion=1.0.0&createdAt=2024-07-29T11%3A25%3A17.090Z&slug=exp&projectId=bff9e86a-41a5-4377-9e99-7ba9a71dd442&group=04e621e4-00f5-4322-a8d4-5d5153c43fee).
